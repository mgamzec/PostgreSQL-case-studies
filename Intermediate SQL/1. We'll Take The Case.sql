Basic CASE statements
What is your favorite team?
The European Soccer Database contains data about 12,800 matches from 11 countries played between 2011-2015! Throughout this course, you will be shown filtered versions of the tables in this database in order to better explore their contents.
In this exercise, you will identify matches played between FC Schalke 04 and FC Bayern Munich. There are 2 teams identified in each match in the hometeam_id and awayteam_id columns, available to you in the filtered matches_germany table. ID can join to the team_api_id column in the teams_germany table, but you cannot perform a join on both at the same time.
However, you can perform this operation using a CASE statement once you've identified the team_api_id associated with each team!
